# The-Dictator

Sacha Baron Cohen's character in The Dictator resembles what we might think of when imagining an authoritarian leader - a power hungry man in charge of millions of comparartively poor, less educated people in a country with a relatively weak economy. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his successor son Lee Hsien Loong defy this expectation by governing over a country with a thriving education system and private sector while also, as suggested by this analysis, maintaining a highly authoritarian government.
